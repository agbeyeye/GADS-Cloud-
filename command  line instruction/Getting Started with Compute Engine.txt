Getting Started with Compute Engine

Objective of this Lab
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.

Task 1: Create an Instance my-vm-1
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

Task 2: Create an Instance my-vm-2 in another zone
-see list of zones
gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

-Set default zone for instance
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

-create instance
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

Task 3: Ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2 instance
-Click SSH on my-vm-2 instance row and enter the command below
ping my-vm-1

-Open SSH on my-vm-1 instance from my-vm-2
ssh my-vm-1
***If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity, enter yes to confirm that you do***

Task 4: Install the NGinx web server on my-vm-1
sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

-Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

-Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name
Hi from YOUR_NAME

-Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command
curl http://localhost/

-To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command
curl http://my-vm-1/
